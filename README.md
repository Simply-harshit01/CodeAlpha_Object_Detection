# CodeAlpha_Object_Detection



This project implements a real-time object detection and tracking system using the YOLOv5 model and OpenCV. The system captures video from a webcam, processes each frame to detect objects, and displays the results in real-time.

## Features
- **Real-Time Object Detection**: Leverages YOLOv5 for fast and accurate object detection.
- **Video Stream Processing**: Captures and processes video frames in real-time from a webcam.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS environments with Python and OpenCV installed.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5
   cd yolov5
## Install the Required Dependencies
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install opencv-python torch matplotlib

## Usage
   1.**Run the Object Detection Script**

   ```bash
    python object_detection.py
